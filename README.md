# Online Market – Java OOP E-Commerce System

Developed as part of Afeka College coursework in Object-Oriented Programming (2024).

## 📦 Overview

This is a Java-based e-commerce simulation project supporting both buyers and sellers. The system implements:
- User registration & login
- Cart and order management
- Product listings by sellers
- Product filtering, string processing
- Reusable cart history and iterator demonstrations

## 🧠 Key Design Patterns Used

- **Factory** – For Buyer/Seller/Product/Cart creation
- **Singleton & Facade** – For system control via MarketFacade
- **Observer** – Notifications on iterator completion
- **Command** – Menu and user command execution
- **Memento** – Cart state save/restore
- **Decorator** – Enhanced list iteration behavior

## 💻 Technologies

- Java SE
- Collections (ArrayList, LinkedHashMap, TreeSet)
- Custom Exceptions
- OOP Principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism)

## 🧪 Features

- Cart duplication & restore (Memento)
- Sorting product names (length, frequency)
- Case-insensitive string processing
- Menu-based CLI with iterator options

## 🏁 How to Run

1. Open the `Main` class.
2. Run via any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).
3. Use menu for actions like user/product creation, order management, and design pattern demos.
