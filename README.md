# Online Market – Java OOP E-Commerce System

Java-based e-commerce simulation project developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming course at Afeka College (2024).

## Overview

This CLI-based system allows buyers and sellers to:
- Register and log in
- Add and manage products
- Browse by category
- Build and restore carts
- Place and manage orders

Includes string processing tasks and category filters, simulating key e-commerce behaviors.

## Design Patterns Implemented

- **Factory** – For creating system objects like `Buyer`, `Product`, etc.
- **Singleton / Facade** – Centralized system control
- **Memento** – Cart state history
- **Command** – Menu and actions
- **Decorator** – Iterator enhancement
- **Observer** – Notify when iteration ends

## Technologies

- Java SE (OOP)
- Collections: `ArrayList`, `TreeSet`, `LinkedHashMap`
- Custom exceptions, enums, CLI menus

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Open `Main.java` in your IDE
